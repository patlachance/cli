Quick steps: How to create a forj?
----------------------------------

    forj setup # follow the instructions

1.  Setup your first forj account.

    `$ forj setup [Provider]`

    Ex: `forj setup hpcloud`. In this example, your account will be named 'hpcloud'.
    **WARNING!!!** [Provider] is currently not supported. By default, it is using hpcloud as default provider.

2.  Create your forge on your default account

    `$ forj boot <blueprint> on hpcloud as <InstanceName>`

    Ex: `forj boot redstone on hpcloud as MyForge`


###Forj options:

To get forj cli help, just type:

    $ forj

To get help on specific action, just type:

 Examples of possible actions:

Commands:

  forj boot <Blueprint> on <Provider> as <InstanceName> [options]  # boot a Maestro box and instruct it to provision the blueprint

  forj down                                                        # delete the Maestro box and all systems installed by the blueprint

  forj help [action]                                               # Describe available FORJ actions or one specific action

  forj setup                                                       # set the credentials for forj cli

  forj show defaults                                               # Show list of predefined value you can update in your ~/.forj/config.yaml

  forj ssh 


#### config.yaml description

While building your forge, forj needs to load some data by default. Those are listed in forj-<version>/lib/defaults.yaml

If you need to change one of this default value, update a ~/.forj/config.yaml file, with any kind of data that need to be changed.

Here are the variables list you can set:

     default:
       account_name: name       # Default forj account used to connect to your cloud. This setting is automatically set to the first account created with forj setup <CloudProvider>
       maestro_url: url         # Maestro GIT repository for clone.
       infra_repo: path         # Path to the default Infra repository used to store your specific bootstrap/build environment. By default: ~/.forj/infra
       image: imageName         # NOT CURRENTLY USED. Still under development.
                                # Image used to create Maestro and all forge boxes. By default, it is 'Ubuntu Precise 12.04.4 LTS Server 64-bit 20140414 (Rescue Image)'
                                # If you have created the generic proto2b image, you can set it here.
       flavor: flavorName       # NOT CURRENTLY USED. Still under development.
                                # Maestro Flavor name. This flavor is for Maestro only. Your blueprint layout defines each node flavors on needs.
                                # By default: standard.xsmall
       ports: [Port1,Port2,...] # list of additional ports to add in your cloud security group.
                                # This list is added to the default one in defaults.yaml
       keypair_path: path       # Define the file path to your OpenSSH private key. Useful to access your box with ssh command line.
                                # By default. ~/.forj/keypairs/nova
       keypair_name: name       # keypair name defined in your cloud to access your server. By default we named it 'nova'. If it doesn't exist, it will be created.
       router: name             # Router name used by your forge boxes will use to access internet.
       security_group: name     # Security group name to configure and attach to each forge boxes.
       network: name            # Network name to attach to each forge boxes. By default we use 'private'. If it doesn't exist, it will be created.
       # Internal use.
       build_config: name       # forj cli use 'build.sh' to create Maestro. See build_config option on build.sh to get more information. By default 'box'
       branch: name             # forj cli use 'build.sh' to create Maestro. See gitbranch option on build.sh to get more information. By default 'master'
       box_name: maestro        # forj cli use 'build.sh' to create Maestro. See box_name option on build.sh to get more information. By default 'maestro'

To ssh into a server

    forj ssh <name> <node>
    e.g. forj ssh maestro_01 [maestro, ci, util, review] # the nodes from your blueprint
